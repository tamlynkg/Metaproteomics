Series of scripts used on metaproteomics data.

"MetaNovo is an open-source pipeline that integrates existing tools with a custom algorithm to produce targeted databases for mass spectrometry analysis. As inputs it requires raw mass spectrometry data in MGF format, and a UniProt FASTA file to search"

"MaxQuant is a quantitative proteomics software package designed for analyzing large mass-spectrometric data sets."

A series scripts were adapted from Matthys Potgieter and Argahavan Alistolani.
